  abstract = {Abstract             Objective Maintaining patient privacy is a challenge in large-scale observational research. To assist in reducing the risk of identifying study subjects through publicly available data, we introduce a method for obscuring date information for clinical events and patient characteristics.             Methods The method, which we call Shift and Truncate (SANT), obscures date information to any desired granularity. Shift and Truncate first assigns each patient a random shift value, such that all dates in that patient's record are shifted by that amount. Data are then truncated from the beginning and end of the data set.             Results The data set can be proven to not disclose temporal information finer than the chosen granularity. Unlike previous strategies such as a simple shift, it remains robust to frequent \textendash{} even daily \textendash{} updates and robust to inferring dates at the beginning and end of date-shifted data sets. Time-of-day may be retained or obscured, depending on the goal and anticipated knowledge of the data recipient.             Conclusions The method can be useful as a scientific approach for reducing re-identification risk under the Privacy Rule of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and may contribute to qualification for the Safe Harbor implementation.},

Materials and Methods               A 4-step framework based on significant temporal event pair detection is described and implemented as an open-source R package. It is used on a population-based Estonian dataset to first replicate a large Danish population-based study and second, to conduct a disease trajectory detection study for type 2 diabetes patients in the Estonian and Dutch databases as an example.                                         Results               As a proof of concept, we apply the methods in the Estonian database and provide a detailed breakdown of our findings. All Estonian population-based event pairs are shown. We compare the event pairs identified from Estonia to Danish and Dutch data and discuss the causes of the differences. The overlap in the results was only 2.4\%, which highlights the need for running similar studies in different populations.                                         Conclusions               For the first time, there is a complete software package for detecting disease trajectories in health data.},
